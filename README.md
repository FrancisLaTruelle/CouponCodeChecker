# Coupon Code Checker / Bruteforce script
Script that tries the most commonly used coupon codes on different websites.

How to use:

1. First with the use of inspect elements, copy the "id" of the input element and the "class" name of the button where you enter coupon codes.
2. Paste the id and class name at the top of the script (Input = the id & Button = class name) Dont forget the  -> " ". 
3. Now select Console in inspect elements and paste the script and press enter.
4. Choose the delay between checking code (maybe 2-4 seconds). 

It's preloaded with 134 coupon codes that i guess is the most commonly used. You can add more if you want but remember to change "qty" to toal number of coupons.
I've noticed that you can get IP blocked by some websites (you wont be able to enter coupon codes). A VPN will fix that.
